# StarterKit_Pic_Programmer
PIC Microcontroller programmer using the StartKit

Please refer to the PIC In-Circuit programming document to understand the meaning of the following content.

This project is not intended to be a professional tool.
There are many programmers on the market and is senseless to create another one.
Use this as a didactic project to understand how the In-Circuit programming works.

This project is a full In-Circuit PIC10 programmer using the StartKit as cpu for logic signal generation.
You need the Adapter circuit to connect the StarteKit to the PIC10 cpu.
This adapter will work in two different ways.
- the socket can be use to insert the PIC device that needs programming. This is clearly a "non In-Circuit" option.
- in the socket can be inserted a plug that connect to the target board. This is the In-Circuit option.
I'm planning to create a 3D printer plug for rapid attach on the target board.
This plug will get the signals from the socket.

You may create your own branch.
You may create your own fork but following the license.
Up to now there is no restriction in wath can be changed.
I just ask to not introduce modern programming paradigmas.
Keep code simple so that anyon can read and understand.

Create a pull-request if you wish to merge it into main.

See wiki page for detailed explanation.
